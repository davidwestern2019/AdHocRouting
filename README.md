## To Do
1. Add functions for generating RREQ
2. Add functions for generating RREP
3. Add functions for generating RERR
4. Add TTL for RREQ dissemination
5. Add AODVRoutingTable updates 

## Running the code

This code is currently stand alone classes, but I added test.cc to so we can test while we develop. 

1. Clone this repository 
2. Using a terminal, cd into the src directory and type 'make'
3. Code should compile and you can run ./test to run the tests

I use Visual Studio Code to develop. It has a nice built in terminal.
