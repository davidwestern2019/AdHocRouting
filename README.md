## Running the code

This code is currently stand alone classes, but I added test.cc to so we can test while we develop. 

1. Clone this repository 
2. Using a terminal, cd into the src directory and type 'make'
3. Code should compile and you can run ./test to run the tests

I use Visual Studio Code to develop. It has a nice built in terminal.
